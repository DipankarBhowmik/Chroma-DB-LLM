# Enhancing Medical Report Findings with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Integrating LLM Models and Chroma DB using the LangChain framework for searchable data.
A poc for RAG on medical pdf reports

## At first collect the MRI Scan PDF reports.
## Convert it to text.
## By regular expression remove private data.
## Then using REGEX capture the information fields.
## After that convert to json
## Followed by conversion of Chroma DB format
## Then chunking the text
## Use Hugging Face Embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
## Followed by storing and saving the Embeddings in ChromaDB.
## There after test the solution
